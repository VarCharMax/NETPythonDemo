As I'd been going back to study Python, I thought the next step was to integrate it with .NET.

You know, functional programming ... A scripting language seemed the best way to implement this.
You can do functional programming in .NET, but it has to be done in the context of an object, so ...

As Python is one of the nost widely used languages, I assumed support for integration with
.NET would be mature by now. Unfortunately, it isn't, and I'm not sure I'd recommend using
it in production, especially in Core 9+, as it isn't fully compatible.
